# AutoClicker

## Introduction
An application that automates an array of mouse and keyboard inputs using the 
pynput and tkinter libraries.

## Features
### Current:
- Repeated clicking with a set persistent delay by pressing the key f6
- Toggle between a set position or the current location of the mouse
- Choose the type of mouse button being pressed: left, middle, or right
- Choose between single clicks, double clicks, or holding the button

### Upcoming:
- Record mouse movement and clicking with infinite playback
- Read/write recorded mouse inputs

## Required Libraries
- tkinter
- pynput

## Notes
- As the nature of timing things with computers is very hard to do 
  accurately, the precision of the delay between clicks will likely be 
  off by tens, or in extreme cases, hundreds of milliseconds.

    application, thus some features and designs were replicated for this 
    project.
